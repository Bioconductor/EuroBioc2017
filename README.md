## Introduction

The 2017 edition of the European Bioconductor meeting will be held in
the [Betty and Gordon Moore
Library](http://moore.libraries.cam.ac.uk/location-maps), Centre for
Mathemtical Sciences, at the University of Cambridge, UK.

The meeting is aimed at biologists, bioinformaticians, programmers,
software engineers who use or contribute to the Bioconductor project,
or are interested in using Bioconductor. The goals are to:

* foster the exchange of technical expertise
* keep contributors up to speed with the latest developments
* coordinate any related efforts.

It will be a 3 days event. The main conference will be on Tuesday 5
and Wednesday 6 December 2017. The conference will feature invited
talks as well as contributed flashlight sessions. We will also have
special interest group (SIG) sessions on Monday 4th December, in the
afternoon (see details below).

## Code of conduct

Bioconductor is built on the free and open exchange of scientific
ideas, and the contributions of our diverse user community. In this
spirit, EuroBioc 2017 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free
conference experience for everyone. Harassment of any form (verbal,
physical, sexual, or other) will not be tolerated in talks, workshops,
poster sessions, social activities, or online.

## Registration

## Special Interest Groups

We invite participants to form groups dedicated to discuss or work on
topics of interest on Monday afternoon. We have booked rooms for the
respective groups. The topics are set by one group leader, and are
advertised in advance of the event on the conference page. 

To create a special interest
group,
[open an issue](https://github.com/Bioconductor/EuroBioc2017/issues)
describing the topic. The issue title should start with `SIG:`
followed by a short but descriptive title. Describe the topic in the
main body of the issue in as much detail as necessary, including the
name of the topic leader, possible or desired outputs (could be code,
a piece of documentation, or general discussion), ... Any interested
participants are invited to use the issue to ask questions and/or
express their interest in participating.



## Flashlight talks

Flashlights are intended to be short presentations covering a single
topic e.g. a new package or a particular technical problem you have
encountered.  Each talk has been allotted 10 minutes and presenters
should aim for approximately 6 slides.  The following rules will apply
in these sessions in order to keep things flowing:

* There will be a warning at 9 minutes
* Flashlight talks will be interrupted (possibly mid-syllable) at the
  10 minute mark regardless of how many slides the speaker has left.
* At this point the next talk will be set up on the computer, allowing
  the next speaker to get going immediately that their time
  begins. This means that the computer will not be available during
  question(s)
* Time has been allowed for one question per talk. If the first
  question is exceedingly brief it is at the chair's discretion as to
  whether a second question will be taken.

Otherwise, there are a number of hotels to the north of the city that are both
fairly cheap should be relatively easy to travel to the venue
from. These include:

  the Citi8 bus service from Cambridge Road to Victoria Road, which is
  a short walk from the conference venue.

Another alternative is the Cambridge Central Travel Lodge, which is
close to the Uni 4 bus route that stops outside the conference venue

## Previous meetings

If you haven't attended any European Bioc meeting before, you can get
an idea about the topics and talks by looking at the programmes from
the [2016](http://www.scicore.ch/events/eurobioc2016/) and
[2015](https://sites.google.com/site/eurobioc2015/) editions.
